Eporter::Easy gets rid of the drudgery of exporting symbols allowing you to
eliminate those bits of code that exists in every single module that uses
Exporter.

It also allows you to define tags in terms of other tags  and you no longer
have to worry about filling in @EXPORT_OK.

Exporter::Easiest lets you do even less typing, epxorting symbols can't get
any easier than this!
